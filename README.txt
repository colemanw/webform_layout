Description
-----------
This module lets you create layout boxes for webforms. You can use these containers to arrange fields into rows and columns.

How to use
----------
- Go to the main field list of a webform.
- Add a layout box to your form.
- Check the "Equal Width" box to divide the space equally between children.
- Add or drag other fields into the container.
- Be careful, some component too wide by default (e.g. textfield). So, you may need to adjust them in order to fit side-by-side.
- If you need a title and/or description for your group you have to insert the layout container into a fieldset.
- Note: The "Equal Width" feature works up to 9 children.
